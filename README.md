# DIABETES PREDICTION : cLASSIFICATION,NEURAL NETWORK AND MFLOW

I used a Diabetes dataset acquired from Kaggle.The main things I did are: I created  a prediction model using KNN, Created a Neural Network using Scikit-Learn and deployed the model using MLflow and Streamlit for prediction .

# KNN CLASSIFICATION:




# NEURAL NETWORK



# MFflow
